Implementing a monthly maintenance payment system in your Next.js dashboard is a great way to manage user subscriptions and ensure consistent revenue. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you integrate this feature using TypeScript, Clerk, MongoDB, and Shadcn UI.

## üßæ Feature Overview

**User Dashboard:**

* **Upcoming Payments:** Automatically generate a pending payment for the 1st‚Äì7th of each month.
* **Total Due:** On the 8th, if the current month's payment isn't made, it adds to the total due.
* **Past Payments:** Display a table of all previous payments.
* **Payment Button:** Users can select specific months to pay for.
* **Discount Notification:** A popup or notification offering a 5% discount for paying 6 months in advance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. **Database Schema (MongoDB)**

Define a `payments` collection with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  userId: string;
  amount: number;
  dueDate: Date;
  paidDate: Date | null;
  status: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'overdue';
}
```

This schema allows you to track each user's payments, amounts, due dates, and statuses.

### 2. **Payment Calculation Logic**

* **Upcoming Payment:** On the 1st‚Äì7th of each month, generate a new payment record with a due date of the 8th.
* **Total Due:** If the payment isn't made by the 8th, mark it as overdue and add it to the total due.
* **Payment Button:** When users click "Pay," calculate the total amount based on selected months and proceed with the payment process.

### 3. **Frontend Components (Shadcn UI)**

Utilize Shadcn UI components to create a user-friendly interface:

* **Table:** Display past payments with columns for amount, due date, paid date, and status.
* **Checkboxes:** Allow users to select specific months to pay for.
* **Button:** A "Pay" button that triggers the payment process.
* **Popup/Notification:** Inform users about the 5% discount for paying 6 months in advance.

You can find examples of Shadcn UI components in the [awesome-shadcn-ui-example](https://github.com/bitaccountants/awesome-shadcn-ui-example) repository.

### 4. **Payment Integration (Stripe)**

Integrate Stripe to handle payments:

* **Create Products and Prices:** Define products and pricing plans in your Stripe dashboard.
* **Create Checkout Sessions:** Use Stripe's API to create checkout sessions for the selected payment amounts.
* **Handle Webhooks:** Set up webhooks to listen for payment events and update the payment status in your database accordingly.

### 5. **Discount Logic**

Implement logic to offer a 5% discount for users paying 6 months in advance:

* **Calculate Discount:** If a user selects 6 months, apply a 5% discount to the total amount.
* **Display Notification:** Show a popup or notification informing the user about the discount.

### 6. **Backend API Endpoints**

Create API endpoints to handle payment-related operations:

* `GET /api/payments`: Fetch the user's payment history.
* `POST /api/payments`: Create a new payment record.
* `POST /api/payments/checkout`: Initiate a Stripe checkout session.
* `POST /api/payments/webhook`: Handle Stripe webhooks to update payment statuses.
